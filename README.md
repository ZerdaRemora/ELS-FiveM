### Fork Changes
* Enabled support for cruise lights
  * Configure extras 1 through 9 to be cruise lights in the relevant vcf file
  * Requires lights to be on stage 0
  * Currently no environmental light casting for cruise lights
* Renamed some vcf files to uppercase to match the vcf.lua file (to play better on Linux-based servers)
